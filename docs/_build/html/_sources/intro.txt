Introduction
==============

mdfelib helps to process XML instance documents that obey the
mdfe XML schema.

With mdfelib (mdfelib.py) you can write
Python code to:

- Parse an XML document that obeys the mdfe XML schema,
  creating instances of the Python classes that represent the types
  defined in the mdfe schema.  These Python classes are
  defined in mdfelib.py.

- Create instances of classes that represent the types described in
  the mdfe XML schema.

- Write Python application code that uses the classes that
  represent mdfe types.

- Export the objects to an XML document.


Schemas
---------

The mdfelib.py module in this package was generated from the
XML schemas in ./schemas.


generateDS.py
---------------

The mdfelib.py module in this package was generated by
generateDS.py.  You can learn about generateDS.py here:
